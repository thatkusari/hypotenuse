# Hypotenuse Calculator
I just wanted to build a calculator for the stuff that im learning in maths. This is entirely made in python since i wanted to refresh my python skills.
If you are the type of person to complain that "JUST MAKE A FUCKING .EXE FILE AND GIVE IT TO ME" and "I DONT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE FUCKING CODE! i just want to download this stupid fucking application and use it

WHY IS THERE CODE??? MAKE A FUCKING .EXE FILE AND GIVE IT TO ME. these dumbfucks think that everyone is a developer and understands code. well i am not and i don't understand it. I only know to download and install applications. SO WHY THE FUCK IS THERE CODE? make an EXE file and give it to me. STUPID FUCKING SMELLY NERDS" then you can go to the releases tab and get that exe file.

# How do i build this?
idfk. **THIS APPLIES TO WINDOWS BUT IT SHOULD ALSO BE THE SAME FOR MAC AND LINUX** Get python. then do this

```pip install pyside6 pyinstaller```

Then you build the thing with this:

```pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile hippo.py```

Now you have an executable for your computer.
